# Local to AWS Development Plan for Trading Application

Here's a comprehensive plan to move from local development to AWS deployment while minimizing costs:

## Phase 1: Local Development Setup

1. **Set up local Kubernetes environment**
   - Install Minikube or Docker Desktop with Kubernetes
   - Set resource limits appropriate for your machine (at least 8GB RAM, 4 CPUs)
   - Enable necessary add-ons: ingress, dashboard, metrics-server

2. **Containerize all services**
   - Ensure all Dockerfiles are optimized and working
   - Create multi-stage builds to reduce image sizes
   - Tag images with consistent versioning scheme

3. **Create local Kubernetes manifests**
   - Separate development-specific configurations from production
   - Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment variables
   - Set up local ingress for frontend and API services

4. **Set up local database**
   - Deploy PostgreSQL with persistent volume
   - Create initialization scripts for schemas
   - Implement the connection pooling we just added

5. **Implement local service mesh (optional)**
   - Consider lightweight service mesh like Linkerd for local testing
   - Implement basic traffic management rules

## Phase 2: Local Testing and Debugging

1. **Implement comprehensive logging**
   - Configure structured logging in all services
   - Set up local log aggregation (e.g., Loki with Grafana)
   - Add request IDs for tracing across services

2. **Set up monitoring**
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana locally
   - Add service metrics endpoints
   - Create basic dashboards for key metrics

3. **Create automated testing**
   - Unit tests for critical components
   - Integration tests for service interactions
   - End-to-end tests for core workflows

4. **Implement CI pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions or similar for automated builds
   - Run tests on each commit
   - Build and tag Docker images

5. **Debug and fix issues**
   - Address bugs in frontend-backend communication
   - Fix any service discovery problems
   - Ensure database connection pooling works correctly

## Phase 3: AWS Preparation (Minimal Cost)

1. **Set up AWS account with cost controls**
   - Set billing alarms
   - Use AWS Free Tier where possible
   - Create IAM users with least privilege

2. **Create ECR repositories**
   - One repository per service
   - Set up lifecycle policies to limit image versions

3. **Prepare infrastructure as code**
   - Use Terraform or AWS CDK
   - Define VPC, subnets, security groups
   - Create modular components for reuse

4. **Configure AWS authentication**
   - Set up AWS CLI credentials
   - Configure kubectl to work with EKS
   - Create service accounts for CI/CD

5. **Plan AWS resources minimally**
   - Design for smallest viable cluster
   - Use Fargate for initial testing (pay per use)
   - Plan scaling strategies for production

## Phase 4: Staged AWS Deployment

1. **Deploy minimal infrastructure**
   - Create EKS cluster with smallest nodes (t3.medium)
   - Single-node RDS instance (or use Aurora Serverless for dev/test)
   - Set up CloudFront with minimal configuration

2. **Deploy core services**
   - Authentication services
   - Database migrations
   - Basic frontend

3. **Implement CI/CD for AWS**
   - Configure GitHub Actions for AWS deployment
   - Set up automated testing in AWS environment
   - Implement blue/green deployment strategy

4. **Test and validate AWS deployment**
   - Verify all services function correctly
   - Test connection pooling under load
   - Validate monitoring and logging

5. **Optimize costs**
   - Implement auto-scaling based on time and load
   - Schedule dev/test environments to shut down after hours
   - Use Spot Instances for non-critical components

## Phase 5: Production Preparation

1. **Implement security enhancements**
   - Network policies
   - WAF rules
   - Secret rotation

2. **Set up high availability**
   - Multi-AZ database
   - Node groups across availability zones
   - Regional redundancy for critical services

3. **Performance testing**
   - Load testing with realistic trading scenarios
   - Identify and fix bottlenecks
   - Optimize resource allocation

4. **Disaster recovery planning**
   - Database backup and restore procedures
   - Cross-region replication strategy
   - Service degradation handling

5. **Documentation and runbooks**
   - Create operational procedures
   - Document architecture
   - Create incident response playbooks

## Cost-Saving Tips During Development

1. **Use ephemeral environments**
   - Spin up AWS resources only when needed
   - Automatically shut down dev/test environments after working hours
   - Consider using GitHub Codespaces for development

2. **Optimize EKS costs**
   - Start with smallest viable node size (t3.medium)
   - Use managed node groups with Spot Instances for non-critical workloads
   - Implement cluster autoscaling

3. **Database cost management**
   - Use RDS t-class instances for development
   - Consider Aurora Serverless for dev/test environments
   - Automate backups but limit retention period for non-production

4. **Use AWS Free Tier effectively**
   - Leverage ECR, CloudWatch, and Lambda free tier allowances
   - Use S3 for static content (with limits)
   - Utilize free tier VPC and data transfer allowances

5. **CI/CD optimization**
   - Cache Docker layers to speed up builds
   - Run heavy testing locally first
   - Limit AWS resources created by CI/CD pipelines

## Rapid Development Tools

1. **Development convenience tools**
   - Skaffold for local Kubernetes development
   - Tilt for fast rebuilds and deployments
   - Telepresence for local-to-cluster development

2. **Local-to-remote debugging**
   - Configure remote debugging capabilities
   - Set up port-forwarding scripts
   - Use Visual Studio Code's Kubernetes extension

3. **Monitoring dashboard**
   - Simple local dashboard for service health
   - Database connection monitoring
   - Real-time log viewing

This plan will help you develop and test locally as much as possible before moving to AWS, minimizing costs while ensuring a robust and production-ready application.
