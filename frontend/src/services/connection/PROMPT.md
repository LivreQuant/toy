# Frontend Connectivity and Session Management Enhancement Plan

## Context
We're developing a trading simulator frontend with robust connection management, focusing on creating a seamless user experience across various network conditions and browser interactions.

## Current Implementation
- WebSocket and SSE-based connection management
- Token-based authentication
- Session persistence across tabs
- Recovery mechanisms for network interruptions

## Objectives
1. Enhance connection resilience
2. Improve user experience during connectivity issues
3. Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies

## Key Areas of Focus
- Page refresh handling
- Multi-tab session synchronization
- Network condition adaptability
- Proactive connection health monitoring

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Implement detailed connection health tracking
2. Develop comprehensive recovery strategies
3. Create graceful degradation UI components
4. Add telemetry and logging for connection events

## Specific Technical Challenges to Address
- Maintaining simulator state during disconnections
- Synchronizing sessions across browser tabs
- Handling token refresh and re-authentication
- Providing clear user feedback during connection issues

## Potential Implementation Approaches
- Enhance `RecoveryManager`
- Implement cross-tab session communication
- Create more granular connection state management
- Develop proactive connection health monitoring

## Questions for Tomorrow
1. How can we further improve the circuit breaker implementation?
2. What additional telemetry would be valuable for tracking connection quality?
3. How can we make the reconnection process more intelligent and user-friendly?

## Action Items
- Review current connection management code
- Prototype enhanced recovery mechanisms
- Design more informative connection status UI
- Create test scenarios for various network conditions
