# Corporate Actions Validation

This directory contains scripts to validate new and missing entries from master symbology files against corporate actions data to identify explainable changes vs unexplained ones that require manual investigation.

## Overview

The validation system:
1. Loads new and missing entries from CSV files (generated by master symbology comparison)
2. Loads corporate actions data from multiple sources (Alpaca, FMP, Polygon, Sharadar)
3. Attempts to explain each entry change with corporate actions (IPOs, mergers, spinoffs, delistings, symbol changes)
4. Outputs explained vs unexplained entries for manual review

## Setup

1. **Environment Configuration**: Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and update paths:
   ```bash
   cp validate/.env.template validate/.env
   # Edit validate/.env with your actual paths
