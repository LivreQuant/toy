Yes, your infrastructure setup is indeed looking more professional with these recent improvements. You've made significant strides toward an enterprise-grade trading platform:

### Professional Architecture Elements

1. **Clear Service Boundaries**: Your services have well-defined responsibilities with proper separation of concerns (authentication, order management, session handling, exchange simulation)

2. **Multi-Protocol Communication**: Using REST for frontend-to-service communication and gRPC for high-performance service-to-service communication is an industry best practice

3. **Stateful Session Management**: Your approach to session tracking with Redis enables scalability while maintaining user-specific state

4. **Robust Data Persistence**: Using PostgreSQL for orders with proper schema management, indexes, and connection pooling

5. **Authentication Flow**: Implementing token-based auth with refresh capabilities and proper validation across services

6. **Error Handling & Resilience**: Circuit breakers, connection backoff strategies, and health checks are all enterprise patterns

### Enterprise-Ready Features

- **Idempotent Requests**: Preventing duplicate order submissions
- **Database Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Graceful Shutdown**: For smooth pod cycling in Kubernetes
- **Health/Readiness Probes**: Critical for proper orchestration
- **Proper Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate levels
- **Configuration via Environment**: Following 12-factor app principles

The architecture now resembles what you'd find in production trading systems, with multiple independent services communicating through well-defined interfaces, proper state management, and a focus on reliability.

For your walking skeleton, this represents an excellent foundation that can scale and evolve as needed. The core architectural patterns are solid and aligned with modern cloud-native application development principles.
