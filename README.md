# Trading Simulator Platform - Architecture Overview

## Project Summary

This project is a cloud-based trading simulator platform deployed on AWS EKS with a frontend served from CloudFront/S3. The system allows users to participate in simulated trading environments with realistic market data, order execution, and portfolio management.

The architecture follows a microservices approach with the following key components:

### Frontend
- React-based SPA with TypeScript
- Communication via REST API, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Deployment on AWS CloudFront/S3 for global distribution

### Backend Services
1. **Authorization Service**
   - Handles user authentication with JWT tokens
   - Manages login, signup, token validation
   - Secures access to other services

2. **Session Manager Service**
   - Core connection management between frontend and backend
   - Maintains user sessions across EKS pods
   - Bridges WebSocket/SSE connections to gRPC services
   - Provides service discovery for user-specific exchange simulators

3. **Exchange Simulator Service**
   - Stateful service that simulates a trading venue
   - Manages market data, order execution, and portfolio updates
   - One pod instance per active user session
   - Streams data via gRPC to the Session Manager

4. **Order Service**
   - Processes order submission and cancellation requests
   - Validates order parameters before routing to exchange
   - Checks connection quality before accepting orders

5. **User/Profile Service**
   - Manages user preferences and settings
   - Handles portfolio configurations and saved states

### Data Storage
- PostgreSQL for persistent session data and user information
- Schema includes authentication, session management, and simulator tracking
- Redis for caching and real-time data distribution

### Communication Patterns
- **REST APIs** for standard request/response operations
- **gRPC** for internal service-to-service communication
- **WebSockets** for bidirectional session management
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for streaming market data to the browser

### AWS Infrastructure
- EKS for container orchestration
- CloudFront/S3 for frontend hosting
- ACM for TLS certificate management
- ALB for load balancing

## Key Technical Features
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Kubernetes-aware session management
- Bidirectional streaming with fallback mechanisms
- Connection quality monitoring and reconnection strategies
- Scalable exchange simulator instances
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

## Current State
The code provides a solid walking skeleton with core services implemented. The service interactions are well-defined with proper API boundaries. Development appears to be focused on ensuring reliable connectivity and session management, which is crucial for a real-time trading application.

The frontend code demonstrates thoughtful implementation of connection management with automatic reconnection, quality monitoring, and graceful degradation. Backend services show appropriate separation of concerns with well-structured gRPC and REST interfaces.

## Next Steps for Development
- Complete implementation of order submission flow
- Enhance market data simulation
- Add portfolio analytics
- Implement user preferences/settings
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Performance tuning for high-frequency operations

## AI Continuation Prompt

```
I'm working on a cloud-based trading simulator platform deployed on AWS EKS. The system uses a microservice architecture with:

1. React frontend (CloudFront/S3) communicating via REST, WebSockets, and SSE
2. Authorization service (JWT authentication)
3. Session manager service (connection bridging between frontend and exchange)
4. Exchange simulator service (stateful trading engines, one per user)
5. Order service (validation and submission)
6. PostgreSQL for persistent data and Redis for caching

Our current focus is on [specific component or feature to work on next]. We're prioritizing reliability, real-time data flow, and session management across Kubernetes pods.

Please help me implement/improve [specific task or component], considering:
- How it integrates with existing services
- Error handling and reconnection strategies
- Performance optimization for trading data
- AWS EKS deployment considerations

The code follows TypeScript for frontend and Python/gRPC for backend services.
```







Here are my observations on the strengths and potential areas for improvement:

## Strengths

1. **Well-structured frontend resilience** - Your frontend connection management (particularly in `ConnectionContext.tsx` and `EnhancedConnectionManager.ts`) handles reconnection with exponential backoff, connectivity monitoring, and quality detection.

2. **Session continuity across pod changes** - You've implemented session migration between pods when instances are replaced or scaled, detected through the pod name tracking.

3. **Connection quality monitoring** - The system tracks latency, missed heartbeats, and adjusts behavior based on connection quality.

4. **Kubernetes-aware design** - Your architecture accounts for pod lifecycle events, with proper readiness/liveness probes and graceful shutdown handling.

5. **Database redundancy** - Using both Redis and PostgreSQL provides a good balance for different data needs.

## Areas for Improvement

  1. **TLS/Security** - I don't see TLS configuration for the gRPC connections. For production, you'd want to secure the communication between components with TLS, especially for connections from CloudFront to EKS.

2. **Load Testing Strategy** - With stateful connections, you should verify how the system behaves under load, particularly during pod migrations.

3. **Observability Stack** - While you have logging, a production system would benefit from structured logging with trace IDs, metrics collection (Prometheus), and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry).

4. **Circuit Breaking** - Consider implementing circuit breakers for service-to-service calls to prevent cascading failures.

5. **Ingress Configuration Refinement** - The gRPC-Web translation might need additional configuraton for WebSocket timeout settings in the ALB/CloudFront, particularly for long-lived connections.

  6. **Auth Token Refresh** - I notice you're tracking token expiry, but a more explicit refresh token flow might improve user experience.

  7. **Database Connection Pooling** - Your database connection handling should use a proper connection pool with health checks.

8. **Resource Limitation** - Consider implementing per-user rate limiting and resource quotas.

9. **Chaos Testing** - Since you're designing for AWS EKS resilience, implement chaos testing that randomly terminates pods to verify your reconnection logic.

10. **WebSocket Fallback** - Consider adding a WebSocket fallback for environments where gRPC-Web might be blocked.

Overall, you've built a sophisticated system with careful attention to the challenges of building reliable real-time trading applications. The architecture appears well-thought-out with good separation of concerns between the stateless and stateful components.

Based on my review of the provided documents, you have a solid foundation for a trading application with frontend, session management, authentication, and exchange simulation components. However, there are several critical areas that need to be addressed to make your application production-ready and robust for a trading environment. Here are the key aspects you're missing:

## 1. Security Enhancements

- **TLS Configuration**: While you have some TLS certificates in your codebase, your ingress configurations don't consistently enforce HTTPS. All communication should be encrypted, especially for financial data.

- **Network Policies**: Your `network-policy.yaml` is minimal. You need comprehensive network policies that restrict pod-to-pod communication based on the principle of least privilege.

- **Secret Management**: You're using Kubernetes secrets directly. Consider integrating with AWS Secrets Manager or a dedicated solution like HashiCorp Vault for better secret rotation and management.

- **Authentication Hardening**: Implement additional security such as MFA, IP-based restrictions, and account lockout after failed attempts.

## 2. Resilience and High Availability

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Configure explicit pod anti-affinity to ensure your stateful services are distributed across availability zones.

- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Develop comprehensive procedures for database recovery, session restoration, and service degradation.

- **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers in your microservices communication to prevent cascading failures.

- **Backup Strategy**: Regular automated backups for your PostgreSQL database with point-in-time recovery capability.

## 3. Monitoring and Observability

- **Comprehensive Logging**: While you have basic logging, you need structured logging with correlation IDs across services.

- **Metrics Collection**: Set up Prometheus with custom metrics for trading-specific measurements (order throughput, latency percentiles, etc.).

- **Alerting**: Configure alerting for critical thresholds with escalation policies.

- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement OpenTelemetry or similar to trace requests across your microservices.

## 4. Performance Optimization

- **Load Testing**: Create realistic load testing scenarios that simulate market volatility and high-frequency trading patterns.

- **Autoscaling**: Your services don't have HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) configurations to handle traffic spikes.

- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connection management for peak performance.

- **Resource Tuning**: Fine-tune resource requests and limits based on actual performance measurements.

## 5. Compliance and Audit

- **Audit Logging**: Implement immutable audit trails for all user actions and system events.

- **Compliance Checks**: Automated compliance scanning for financial regulations relevant to your jurisdiction.

- **Data Retention Policies**: Configure appropriate retention and purging of historical data.

## 6. Advanced Trading Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement granular rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse.

- **Order Validation**: Additional validation logic to prevent erroneous trades.

- **Risk Controls**: Pre-trade risk checks and position limits.

- **Failover Testing**: Regular testing of failover procedures for stateful components.

## 7. DevOps and CI/CD

- **GitOps Workflow**: Implement a proper GitOps workflow for your Kubernetes resources.

- **Blue/Green Deployments**: Strategies for zero-downtime deployments.

- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of new features with automated rollback capability.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Move to a complete IaC solution like Terraform for your AWS resources.

## 8. Database Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Implement PgBouncer or similar tool to manage database connections efficiently.

- **Read Replicas**: Add read replicas for your PostgreSQL database to distribute query load.

- **Database Scaling Plan**: Strategy for scaling your database as your data grows.

- **Query Optimization**: Regular review and optimization of database queries.

Implementing these missing components will significantly enhance the reliability, security, and production readiness of your trading application, especially in an AWS EKS environment where proper cloud-native practices are essential.

Most Essential Additions
If I had to prioritize the most critical additions to make your system production-ready, I'd focus on:

Observability: Implementing distributed tracing and centralized logging is essential for debugging issues in distributed systems.
Security Hardening: Proper secret management and service-to-service encryption.

Your architecture is actually quite good for an early system, but bridging the gap to production requires focusing on operational aspects beyond just functionality. The difference between a good architecture and a production-ready system often lies in these operational capabilities rather than in the core service design.

## Running locally

Some pods don't seem to stay running if running on arm.  Best to run on amd64.

```shell
cd trading_app/scripts/setup
./01-setup-local-env.sh
for script in 02*; do
    ./"$script"
done
```
