Adding debugging and security components to your Kubernetes setup would significantly enhance your development environment. Here are some valuable additions to consider:

## For Debugging

1. **Ksniff**: This is a Kubernetes plugin that allows you to capture network traffic from any pod in your cluster.
   ```bash
   kubectl krew install sniff
   kubectl sniff <pod-name>
   ```
   This captures packets directly from your pods and opens them in Wireshark.

2. **K9s**: A terminal-based UI for managing Kubernetes clusters.
   ```bash
   # Install
   curl -sS https://webinstall.dev/k9s | bash
   # Run
   k9s
   ```
   It provides real-time monitoring and management capabilities with a clean interface.

3. **Kubeshark**: Like "Wireshark for Kubernetes" - captures and analyzes all API traffic.
   ```bash
   sh <(curl -Ls https://get.kubeshark.co)
   kubeshark tap
   ```

4. **Chaos Engineering tools**: Try Chaos Mesh or Litmus Chaos for testing resilience.
   ```bash
   helm install chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --create-namespace
   ```

## For Security

1. **Falco**: Runtime security monitoring using system calls.
   ```bash
   helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
   helm install falco falcosecurity/falco
   ```

2. **Kube-bench**: Checks your cluster against CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks.
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/main/job.yaml
   ```

3. **Trivy** for container vulnerability scanning:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator/main/deploy/manifests/trivy-operator.yaml
   ```

4. **Network Policies**: Implement them to control pod-to-pod communication:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: default-deny
   spec:
     podSelector: {}
     policyTypes:
     - Ingress
     - Egress
   ```

5. **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** for policy enforcement:
   ```bash
   helm install gatekeeper gatekeeper/gatekeeper
   ```

6. **Sealed Secrets** for securing sensitive information:
   ```bash
   helm install sealed-secrets sealed-secrets/sealed-secrets
   ```

For your trading application specifically, I'd recommend starting with Falco for runtime security monitoring and Trivy for checking container vulnerabilities. Network Policies would be especially important to properly isolate your services and prevent unauthorized access between components.
