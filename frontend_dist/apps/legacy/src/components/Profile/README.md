## Implementation Recommendations

### For a Balanced Approach
1. **Multi-step Progressive Form**: 
   - Start with basic information (current implementation)
   - Add conditional sections based on fund size/maturity
   - Keep most complex institutional sections optional

2. **Clear Optional vs. Required Labeling**:
   - Mark core fields as required
   - Clearly indicate institutional-only fields
   - Add tooltips explaining why certain fields matter to allocators

3. **Simplified Service Provider Section**:
   - Include "Not Applicable" and "Planned" options
   - Allow managers to indicate future service plans
   - Include explanatory text for emerging managers

4. **Pre-populated Options**:
   - Include common providers in dropdown lists
   - Add "Other - Please Specify" options
   - Reduce friction for new managers

5. **Importance Indicators**:
   - Visual cues showing which fields matter most to allocators
   - Help text explaining field relevance to different investor types
   - Completion percentage indicators

## Integration with Portfolio Setup
Our design should maintain a clear separation between fund-level information (collected in the fund profile) and portfolio/strategy-level information (captured during book/portfolio setup). This ensures users understand where to input different types of information while providing a comprehensive picture for allocators.

The fund profile should focus on the organization, team, and infrastructure, while specific investment approaches, sector exposures, ESG considerations, and performance metrics should be associated with individual portfolios or books.
